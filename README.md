# Go-SourceAFIS (Modified Version)

This is a **modified clone** of the [Unofficial Go-SourceAFIS](https://github.com/jtejido/go-sourceafis) project. The original implementation was created by [jtejido](https://github.com/jtejido). I have made custom changes to the repository for my own use case and improvements.

## üîç About

Go-SourceAFIS is a port of the SourceAFIS fingerprint recognition algorithm written in Go. It provides a fingerprint matching engine that compares fingerprints and identifies potential matches based on biometric data.


# go-sourceafis
An Unofficial Golang port of SourceAFIS: A library for human fingerprint recognition

go-sourceafis is a pure Golang port of [SourceAFIS](https://sourceafis.machinezoo.com/),
an algorithm for recognition of human fingerprints.
It can compare two fingerprints 1:1 or search a large database 1:N for matching fingerprint.
It takes fingerprint images on input and produces similarity score on output.
Similarity score is then compared to customizable match threshold.
